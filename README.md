# Virtual Object Insertion
This repository contains the code to generate the object insertion results in paper [Inverse rendering for complex indoor scenes: Shape, spatially-varying lighting and svbrdf from a single image, CVPR 2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17K3RrWQ48gQynOhZHq1g5sQgjLjoMiPk/view). 

We hope the code can help people reproduce the photorealistic object insertion results included in our paper and compare future lighting estimation methods more easily. Please consider citing the paper if you find the code useful. Please contact [Zhengqin Li](zhl378@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have any questions towads the code.
